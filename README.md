# Knative distributed tracing

This is a personal project to explore distributed tracing in [knative](https://knative.dev/).

The project shows that knative provides out-of-the-box distributed tracing capabilities (it starts trace and create spans for service/function invocation), but the project also provides instrumentation for Knative eventing client library (Cloudevents) to ensure in-process context propagation (from in-bound to out-bound request/event).

This project implements two services: `first` and `second`. The first service exposes HTTP API on port `8090` and it emits CloudEvent when the API is accessed. The second service consumes this event.

#### How does distributed tracing work in Knative

The Knative data-plane (e.g. activator, controller, queue-proxy) are instrumented with distributed tracing API. These components create tracing data for every transaction (request, event). The trace-context (trace IDs) are not added to the event metadata (e.g. as extension) but are propagated in e.g. in HTTP headers.

The user function/service is however responsible to propagate the headers from in-bound to out-bound event/request. This might not always apply all scenarios (e.g. if events are routed only by control plane).

### Output

Following trace shows end-to-end transaction:

![Trace](./assets/screenshot-jaeger.jpg)
![event-receive](./assets/screenshot-jaeger-event-send-span.jpg)
![event-send](./assets/screenshot-jaeger-event-receive-span.jpg)

* Spans from service `first` are created from application tracer
* Spans from service `second` are created from application tracer
* The spans in red column are "application"/"business logic" spans created explicitly in the services.
* see [raw trace JSON](./assets/jaeger-trace-96fb08cdf0962dc11e32043925f9b46c.json)

The stdout output from the `first` service shows that the incoming request already contains tracing headers - B3 and W3C Trace-Context. The B3 protocol is there probably for compatibility reasons, to make sure older applications instrumented with e.g. Zipkin libraries are able to propagate the context:

The stdout from the `second` service shows that the incoming event does not contain trace-context (trace IDs):
```bash

```

## Prerequisites

Follow the [quickstart](https://knative.dev/docs/getting-started/quickstart-install/) to install `kn`, quickstart plugin and kind with installed knative.

Install Jaeger:
```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy/01-jaeger.yaml
```

Enable distributed tracing in Knative Eventing and Service: 
* https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/accessing-traces/
* https://knative.dev/docs/serving/accessing-traces/

Set the `data.sampling-rate` to `1` and `data.zipkin-endpoint` to `http://jaeger-collector.jaeger.svc.cluster.local:9411/api/v2/spans`

## Build and deploy

```bash
make docker docker-push deploy
```

Now open browser http://first.default.127.0.0.1.sslip.io/

Open Jaeger UI `kubectl port-forward service/jaeger-query 16686:16686 -n jaeger`
